        Do you wish your team knew more about how to make your Ruby on Rails application faster? Performance work can be intimidating at first: it might feel like it's over your head, too boring, or too esoteric. I disagree. My one-day workshops teach the fundamental skills of making Rails web applications fast, and do it in a way that's accessible and memorable.
      </p>

      <h3>Make Your App Faster than "Fast Enough"</h3>

      <p>
        Ruby web applications <b>don't have to be slow</b>, and you don't have to do backflips or refactor your entire application into service objects and microservices to do it. Four of the largest Rails applications in the world are <i>all</i> monolithic Rails applications and they <i>all</i> have response times of less than 100 milliseconds on average - Github, Shopify, Basecamp and Cookpad. None of them use a lot of Javascript or single-page-app frameworks like Vue, React, or Angular (3 out of 4 use Turbolinks!). Frequently, squeezing more performance out of your application ends up being a simple one-line change. Performance optimization is about measurement and experience more than execution, which is why <b>learning the fundamental performance skills of benchmarking, profiling, and measurement</b> can save you and your team <i>weeks</i> of banging your head against the wall and blind, premature optimization. We'll also talk about provisioning and cost savings, including how to use multi-threading and auto-scaling to your advantage. <b>You'll easily pay for the fee just by what I'll teach you about reducing your server costs!</b>
      </p>

      <h3>One-On-One Intensive</h3>

      <p>
        Here's what you and your team will learn:
        <ul>
          <li>Lower your response times to 200 milliseconds or less.</li>
          <li>Reduce how much you're spending on deployment, by as much as half.</li>
          <li>Build a clear plan to scale for the next 12 months.</li>
          <li>Apply the three-step "DRM" method to solve 80% of Rails performance issues quickly and simply.</li>
          <li>Practice a simple, repeatable performance process to diagnose and solve any issue. No genius required.</li>
          <li>Fix any N+1 scenario, even the weird ones that go 12 stack levels deep that you've never been able to figure out.</li>
          <li>Set targets and performance budgets within your organization that make sense for you and your customers.</li>
          <li>Learn how to diagnose performance issues anywhere in the stack: DB, Ruby itself, the browser, and more.</li>
          <li>Understand what "breaks" simple preload/eager_load schemes and how to get around it.</li>
          <li>Scale services mathematically without load testing.</li>
          <li>Decipher metrics on services like NewRelic and Scout.</li>
          <li>Reduce the memory usage of any Rails app.</li>
          <li>... and a whole lot more.</li>
        </ul>
